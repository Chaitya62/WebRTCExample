# WebRTCExample

This simple example only supports video streaming on the same network.
For more complex applications you might need to use a `STUN` or `TURN` server



# Installation 

```sh
# run either 
npm install 

# or 
yarn install

```

# Usage

Open `http://localhost:3001` on your pc.
Use incognito or use some other device on your network to open the second Session 
The url on the other device will look something like 
`http://your-ip:3001`
